      ### this loop is completely unnecessary but demonstrates how the tests gets messed up if the first loop isn't there
      ### if the first loop is commented out, then the first round prints: "place1, of class Place"
      ### and the second round prints: "place1, of class Restaurant"
      ### so for whatever reason they go into the municipality's places as the superclass and subclass
      ### and for whatever reason the count is still only 1, but the loop goes two rounds
